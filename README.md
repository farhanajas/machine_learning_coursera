# machine_learning_coursera
Greetings. I have recently completed the Machine Learning course from Coursera by Andrew NG.  While doing the course we have to go through various quiz and assignments.  Here, I am sharing my solutions for the weekly assignments throughout the course.  These solutions are for reference only.  > It is recommended that you should solve the assignments by yourself honestly then only it makes sense to complete the course. > But, In case you stuck in between, feel free to refer the solutions provided by me.  NOTE: Don't just copy paste the code for the sake of completion.  Even if you copy the code, make sure you understand the code first.
