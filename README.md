# machine_learning_coursera
Greetings. I have recently completed the Machine Learning course from Coursera by Andrew NG. 
Here, I am sharing my solutions for the weekly assignments throughout the course.
> It is recommended that you should solve the assignments by yourself honestly then only it makes sense to complete the course.
> But, In case you stuck in between, feel free to refer the solutions provided by me. 

NOTE: Don't just copy paste the code for the sake of completion.  Even if you copy the code, make sure you understand the code first.
